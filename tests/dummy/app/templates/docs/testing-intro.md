# Testing

Just like other addons, engines must be tested differently depending upon whether they are "in-repo" or "standalone":

* To test an in-repo engine, co-locate the engine's tests with the host app's tests, just like any other in-repo addon.

* To test a standalone engine, use the dummy app, just like any other standalone addon project.

## Setup

### Lazy Engines

If you have a lazy engine, you'll need to ensure that your `tests/test-helper.js` is configured to preload your engine's assets:

```js
// <app-name>/tests/test-helper.js
import Application from '../app';
import config from '../config/environment';
import { setApplication } from '@ember/test-helpers';
import { start } from 'ember-qunit';
import preloadAssets from 'ember-asset-loader/test-support/preload-assets';
import manifest from '<app-name>/config/asset-manifest';

setApplication(Application.create(config.APP));

preloadAssets(manifest).then(start); // This ensures all engine resources are loaded before the tests
```

### Rendering/Unit tests

When you deal with `ember-engines` and you would like to test your engine code (e.g. components and services), you need to make sure that the test environment instantiates the engine. The `setupEngine` helper can be used to automatically load, instantiate, and provide access to the engine.

```js
// tests/<integration or unit>/â€¦
import { setupEngine } from 'ember-engines/test-support';
```

To use it, include it in your test module with the name of your engine.

```js
setupEngine(hooks, '<engine-name>');
```

The engine owner can be accessed in tests through `this.engine`.
