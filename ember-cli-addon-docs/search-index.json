","route":"docs","keywords":[]},"template:docs/addons":{"id":"template:docs/addons","type":"template","title":"Addons","text":"Addons As mentioned before, Engines are created as a specific type of Ember Addon. This makes sense given that Addons are Ember's way to easily share common or reusable code. Since Engines are intended to package logical applications that can be composed, they fit nicely into the paradigm of shareable addons. Addons come in two distinct flavors: Standard and In-Repo. Standard Addons (normally just referred to as Addons) are full-fledged NPM packages that can be distributed and installed in other Ember applications. In-repo-addons, on the other hand, live within the repository of an Ember Application and are only used by that specific application. This distinction is important for Engines, as it is fairly likely to want a logical application represented by an Engine but only use it with a specific Ember Application. In those cases, using an in-repo-engine is a good alternative to consider instead of maintaining two separate repositories. It is recommended to read through the \"Writing Addons\" portion of the Ember-CLI user guide before moving onto the \"Creating An Engine\" portion of the guide. In-repo-addons If you want to use an addon in an engine, you have to add it to the engines dependencies. This is necessary for the following types of addons: Addons that provide components or helpers that you want to use in the engine Addons that provide other utils or similar that you want to use in the engine Addons that provide services that are not passed through from the host app The following types of addons should be placed in the devDependencies: Addons that provide services that are passed through from the host app Addons that do build adaptions Using Ember Data When working with Ember Data, the models are defined in the host app, and you will need to pass the store service through to the engine as a dependency. This way, the host app and the engine use the same store and models. You then need to add ember-data as a devDependency to your engine. The easiest way to realise this is to define your models in a shared addon, which is included by both your host app and your engine. Addon deduplication If you are using ember engines v0.7.1 or higher: Use EMBER_ENGINES_ADDON_DEDUPE environment variable to deduplicate the nested addons of lazy engine which are also host app addons. More details at #595. If you are using ember engines v0.7.0 or less, follow the explanation bellow: ember-engines will automatically try to deduplicate addons used by your host app and (lazy loaded) engine(s). This means that addons that both the host app and an engine rely on, are only included in the vendor bundle of the host app. This ensures that you do not ship the addon code multiple times to your users. If addons are not included in the host app, they will be included in the engine's vendor bundle. Note that the deduplication between host app and addon depends on the cacheKeyForTree() method of the addon. It will only deduplicate if the cache key returned by that method is the same. This will by default be the case, unless the addon provides a custom treeForAddon() hook. If that is the case, the addon should provide a custom cacheKeyForTree() method that returns a static key - for example: const calculateCacheKeyForTree = require('calculate-cache-key-for-tree'); module.exports = { name: require('./package').name, treeForAddon() { // returns custom tree - overwriting this hook disables the default caching! }, cacheKeyForTree(treeType) { if (treeType === 'addon') { return calculateCacheKeyForTree(treeType, this); } return this._super.cacheKeyForTree.apply(this, arguments); } }; Isolation and separation of responsibilities is generally hard to solve. The most recurrent scenario in a composable app with Ember Engines is: Imagine the css or components that are only used by engine-a, engine-b and engine-c all possible cases have down sides here: 1) Include shared deps into the host app - Downside: Increases initial bundle size. 2) Include shared deps into each engine bundle - Downside: Duplicated stuff in multiple engine bundles. 3) Somehow split out shared deps into dedicated bundles (e.g. /engine-assets/shared-by-a-and-b.js) - Downside: You might end up with 20 bundles (e.g. shared-by-a-and-b, shared-by-b-and-c-, shared-by-a-b-and-c, ...), and it is probably pretty complicated from a built step perspective. Engines currently take the second approach, but may allow more options in the future.","route":"docs.addons","keywords":[]},"template:docs/api/item":{"id":"template:docs/api/item","type":"template","title":null,"text":" ","route":"docs.api.item","keywords":[]},"template:docs/bundling":{"id":"template:docs/bundling","type":"template","title":"Bundling","text":"Bundling Ember Engines not only provides isolation principles for how your code is run, but also how it is bundled.

You could set up your app like this: - my-app (workspace) - packages - host-app - engine-a - engine-b - shared-addonIn this example, the actual app would be in the my-app/packages/host-app directory, while my-app/packages/engine-a and my-app/packages/engine-b would be engines. my-app/packages/shared-addon could be a shared addon that is used by the host app & all engines, including for example common components, services or Ember Data models. The advantage of this approach is that all of these dependencies will always be in sync and up to date. If you change something in the shared addon, it will immediately be reflected in the host app and all engines. It also makes it easier to ensure all engines depend on the same versions of addons. Managing multiple addon versions When working with engines, it is important to avoid including different versions of the same addon. Currently, only one addon version can actually be loaded at a time. If your host app and engines depend on different versions of an addon, you will run into hard to control issues. For example, imagine the host app depends on ember-power-select^1.0.0, engine-a depends on ember-power-select~2.0.0 and engine-b depends on ember-power-select~2.1.0. Now, three different versions of ember-power-select would be included in the respective vendor bundles. But which version would actually be used in your app/engine would depend on the order in which the bundles are loaded. Generally, you should ensure that only one version of a given addon is included across your host app and engines. A great way to ensure this is to use ember-cli-dependency-lint, which will tell you if multiple versions of an addon are installed. If you use Yarn, you can use resolutions to force a specific version to be used by an addon. In the above example, you could add the following to your host apps package.json: { \"dependencies\": {}, \"devDependencies\": {}, \"resolutions\": { \"**/ember-power-select\": \"^1.0.0\" } } This would force this version on all addons. Please use this feature with caution, as it is then up to you to make sure that all apps and engines actually work with this version of the addon.","route":"docs.dependencies","keywords":[]},"template:docs/deploying":{"id":"template:docs/deploying","type":"template","title":"Deploying","text":"Deploying Deploying An Engine In many cases, your engine code may be served from a static server, typically a CDN; this server will probably not share the same root location as your application. In order to specify the location to get the engine assets, you can implement a generateURI function in the host application's ember-cli-build.js file: // host-app/ember-cli-build.js let app = new EmberApp(defaults, { assetLoader: { generateURI(filePath) { if (EmberApp.env() === 'production') { return `https://production.cdn.com/${filePath}`; } else { return `local/static/${filePath}`; } } } }); The generateURI function receives the filePath for each asset and must return a string of the asset's location.

Engines allow multiple logical applications to be composed together into a single application from the user's perspective. The key term here is \"logical application\". That is, an Engine represents a set of functionality and user experiences that could logically be considered an application. However, they differ from normal Ember applications in that they are intended to be composed within a host application in order to create a single, cohesive user experience. On a technical level, engines and applications are remarkably similar: they each have their own container, registry, context, and namespace. However, unlike an application, an engine does not boot itself nor does it control its own router. Engines rely on their hosts to fulfill these responsibilities. The often used example of this is a \"blogging\" application. While a blog itself could be a full-fledged application, you may also wish to use it as a specific subsection of your overall application. If you threw a \"news feed\" engine into that mix, you might get an application structure that looks something like this: This host application relies upon Engines to control different \"zones\" of functionality. However, from the user's perspective, the host application and its engines appear to be a single application. Why use Engines? Large organizations often use Ember.js to power sophisticated web applications. These apps may require collaboration among several teams, sometimes distributed around the world. Typically, responsibility is shared by dividing the application into one or more \"sections\". How this division is actually implemented varies from team to team. Maintaining large monolithic applications poses the following challenges: Side effects - if you change something, it may be unclear how it could affect the rest of platform. Coordination - when you develop a new feature or make big changes, many teams may need to be in sync to approve it. Complexity - with a huge dependency tree and many layers of abstraction, developers cannot iterate quickly, and features suffer as a result. Killing Innovation - a/b testing a cutting-edge feature is hard to do without disrupting the rest of the app and the teams working on it. Slow Onboarding - new people coming into the team are overwhelmed. Engines provide an antidote to these problems by allowing for distributed development, testing, and packaging of logically-grouped pieces of an application. Engines are good for organizations that have multiple teams, where each team has their own area that is clearly separated from the others. The isolation is good when it matches organizational boundaries, but adds unnecessary complexity when there is not a good match. Engines are used by a number of organizations, including LinkedIn, Chase, and Square, to power sites with million of users. If you are considering splitting up your application into engines just to reduce the amount of data that needs to be initially downloaded and increase the performance, Engines are not the right solution.

When discussing Engines, isolation refers to the idea of logical run-time separation; that is, separating the code which an Engine can reference from the code which an Application can reference. In practice this means that Engines cannot access or communicate with their host (often referred to as their \"parent\"), except through a few well-defined interfaces. Attempting to access code from the host without explicitly importing it will result in a run-time error. So, things that you might have gotten \"for free\" in an application, now must have ceremony in order to be used by your Engine. At first, and even after working with it for a while, this isolation may seem a bit cumbersome as it requires you to write more code and do more work to use something that you previously got with little effort. This \"ceremony\" of importing, however, is very important as it enables build and run time optimizations that are not possible without those constraints. In particular, one huge benefit of Engines is the ability to lazy-load them. This is only made possible by having explicit interfaces with the consuming application and dependencies so that a dependency graph can be constructed at build time to allow for proper bundling of assets.","route":"docs.isolation","keywords":[]},"template:docs/lazy-loading":{"id":"template:docs/lazy-loading","type":"template","title":"Lazy Loading","text":"Lazy Loading The moment we've all be waiting for, let's talk about lazy loading! If you've been following along and paying attention, we've stressed frequently the idea that Engine's are isolated. Well, assuming you haven't violated those isolations principles anywhere, enabling lazy loading for your Engine is as simple as setting a flag: // super-blog/index.js const EngineAddon = require('ember-engines/lib/engine-addon'); module.exports = EngineAddon.extend({ name: 'super-blog', lazyLoading: { enabled: true } }); Next time you build your application, you should have a lazy loading Engine! Route-less Lazy Engines Currently, lazy loading is not supported natively for route-less Engines. But you can use ember-lazy-mount as solution for while. Progress can be tracked at this issue. Routing Considerations When routing into a routable Engine that is lazily loaded there are some special considerations and subtle differences from how routing works in a normal Ember application. Serialization of URLs Since the links to your Engine are constructed before the Engine itself is loaded, you need to make sure the application has the necessary code to serialize data into the URLs. To that end, you need to replace any Route#serialize functions with route serializers, as defined in the Route Serializers RFC. For example, if you had a Post route defined like so: import Route from \"@ember/routing/route\"; export default class PostRoute extends Route { serialize(model) { return { post_id: model.id }; } }); You would need to remove that function and inline it into your routes.js map, which is loaded pre-emptively with the application: function serializePost(model) { return { post_id: model.id }; } export default buildRoutes(function() { this.route('post', { serialize: serializePost }); }); Note that route serializers are unique to Engines and won't work in normal applications. In a normal Ember application you should continue to use Route#serialize. Loading / Error Substates The loading and error substates work in a similar fashion to substates in a normal Ember app. The only difference is that lazily loaded Engines will enter a loading state while the assets for the Engine are loaded and can enter an error state when an asset fails to load. Built Engine Output Eager Engines Eager engines are built approximately the same as existing addons. Differences are limited to consolidating the namespace of app code inside of an engine into the engine's namespace instead of the host application. Beyond that it adds in a configuration module for the engine, and nothing else. It is a remarkably straightforward process. Lazy Engines Lazy engines are built in the same way as eager engines, but their assets are not combined back into the host application's vendor-{hash}.js file. This means that they are run through a separate and unique build process from what a default addon will go through, though it reaches out to the upstream implementation in Ember CLI where possible. A lazy engine's output (lazy-engine) looks like this: dist ├── assets │ ├── host-application.css │ ├── host-application.js │ ├── vendor-{hash}.css │ └── vendor-{hash}.js ├── engines-dist │ └── lazy-engine | ├── config │ | ├── enviroment.js │ ├── assets │ │ ├── engine-vendor-{hash}.css │ │ ├── engine-vendor-{hash}.js │ │ ├── engine.css │ │ └── engine.js │ └── public-asset.jpg ├── asset-manifest.json ├── crossdomain.xml ├── index.html └── robots.txt /routes.js The routes.js file and anything it imports must be present at boot time of the host application. It will be bundled into the host application's vendor.js file. This location should be considered undefined behavior and should not be relied upon as it may change in the future. Its module name inside of the host application will be lazy-engine/routes. Any imports will also be in the lazy-engine module path. /app Assets in this folder don't make sense, it's a bad idea to use them because they break the isolation guarantees of engines. /addon JavaScript assets in this folder will be processed as per normal addon behavior except that they will end up inside of the engine.js file. Their module definition will be rooted to the engine name. For example, /addon/routes/application.js will result in a JavaScript module named lazy-engine/routes/application inside of the /dist/engines-dist/lazy-engine/engine.js file. /addon/templates Templates will be compiled by your engine but they must include ember-cli-htmlbars inside of dependencies in the engine's package.json. As an example, /addon/templates/application.hbs will result in a JavaScript module named lazy-engine/templates/application inside of the /dist/engines-dist/lazy-engine/engine.js file. /addon/styles/**/*.css CSS files will be built similarly to how they are processed inside of typical adddons. Typical addon behavior is as follows: All nested addons are processed. Each of them may return a style tree. By default these style trees only contain the contents of addon/styles/addon.css. The contents of the addon/styles/addon.css file is moved inside of the Broccoli tree to ${addon-name}.css. This can be modified if the addon specifies a custom treeForStyle hook. All top-level addons (those directly depended upon by the host) have all of addon/styles/**/*.css included into the host's vendor.css file. For example addon/styles/foo.css will appear in the output Broccoli tree at foo.css. If you name a CSS file in one of the top-level addons the same as an addon name (e.g. addon name is alpha), any top-level addon which has a CSS file of the same name as that addon (alpha.css) and is provided by an addon lexicographically after it (zeta) will clobber the contents of alpha/addon/styles/addon.css (from anywhere in the dependency graph) with zeta/addon/styles/alpha.css. (This is also a possible consequence of DAG topsorting.) Lazy engines will use a variation of this approach: The engine itself will be treated as if it is a top-level dependency. This means that addon/styles/**/*.css will end up inside of engine.css. Child addons of a lazy engine will be treated as if they are top-level addons. This means that they will have their treeForStyle hook executed and the result of that hook will be merged into engine-vendor.css in DAG/lexicographic order. Nested lazy engine boundaries will not be crossed when calculating the child treeForStyle hook. /public Assets appearing in the public folder will appear at the root of the engine output with no transformation. For example /public/public-asset.jpg appears at the root level of the /dist/engines-dist/lazy-engine/ output folder. Assets in this folder have no default behavior and you are responsible for any custom behavior. Asset Manifest Further, the engine must enumerate its primary bundles (JS and CSS) in order to be loaded by the asset loading service. That will be generated at /dist/asset-manifest.json at build time. It will also by default be inserted into a meta tag config inside of the host application's index.html. A asset manifest output looks like this: { \"bundles\": { \"guide\": { \"assets\": [ { \"uri\": \"/engines-dist/<lazy-engine>/assets/engine-vendor.js\", \"type\": \"js\" }, { \"uri\": \"/engines-dist/<lazy-engine>/assets/engine.js\", \"type\": \"js\" } ] } } } Nested Eager Engines Nested eager engines will be built into their host engine or application. Modules will be deduplicated within the engine boundary and with the host application. Nested Lazy Engines Nested lazy engines will be promoted to /dist/engines-dist/ folder in the build output. Module deduplication will only be done with the host application.","route":"docs.lazy-loading","keywords":[]},"template:docs/links":{"id":"template:docs/links","type":"template","title":"Links","text":"Links Routing and linking within and between Engines is a bit more complicated than with normal Ember applications. This is because Engines are isolated and thus don't know about routes beyond their own borders. Let's look at what this means practically. Linking Within An Engine Within a routable Engine, route paths are relative to the Engine's \"mount point\". That is, the route path at which it is mounted. In other words, if you're trying to go to route super-blog.posts.index, you might do the following from the host application: <LinkTo @route=\"super-blog.posts.index\">Comments</LinkTo> However, if you are inside the super-blog Engine, you would need to do the following: <LinkTo @route=\"posts.index\">Comments</LinkTo> Notice that the super-blog portion of the path is now missing, this is because that is the Engine's mount point. Previously we mentioned that each Engine has it's own application route, that route corresponds to the mount point when within the Engine. So, if you wanted to go to super-blog (or the root of the Engine) from within the Engine itself, you would do something like: <LinkTo @route=\"application\">Goes to Blog Home</LinkTo> Or, maybe even: <LinkTo @route=\"index\">Also goes to Blog Home</LinkTo> It's a little confusing at first, but the gist is to think of the route paths as if the Engine were it's own application. External Routes If route paths are scoped to an Engine's mount point, then the next logical question is \"what if you need to link to a path that isn't below the mount point?\" We refer to any routes that don't use the Engine's mount point as \"external routes\", because they are effectively \"external\" or \"outside\" the Engine. Since Engines are intended to be isolated, they shouldn't have intimate knowledge of the paths to external routes as they may change depending on where the Engine is mounted. That said, there are legitimate use cases where Engines need to link to routes outside themselves. In order to deal with this, Engines allow you to specify external routes as dependencies: // super-blog/addon/engine.js export default class SuperBlog extends Engine { // ... dependencies = { externalRoutes: [ 'home', 'settings' ] }; } External routes define things that your Engine needs to link to. The host is then responsible for telling you where those things are. In other words, the Engine defines what it would like to go to and the application tells it where that is. This is an important mental shift. Normal links define where they want to go to, but external links define what they want to go to and the host application tells it where that is. So, when you mount your Engine, you'll need to make sure the host specifies appropriate paths for each of the external routes the Engine needs: // dummy/app/app.js import Application from '@ember/application'; export default class App extends Application { // ... constructor() { super(...arguments); this.engines = { superBlog: { dependencies: { externalRoutes: { home: 'home.index', settings: 'settings.blog.index' } } } } } } Note that the Engine name, which is normally dasherized, is camel-cased here instead. You can use these external routes within your Engine via the <LinkToExternal/> component: <LinkToExternal @route=\"home\">Go Home</LinkToExternal> Or, one of the programmatic APIs, such as Route#transitionToExternal and Route#replaceWithExternal: import Route from \"@ember/routing/route\"; import { action } from '@ember/object'; export default class YourRoute extends Route { @action goHome() { this.transitionToExternal('home'); } }); Using External Routes for Internal locations In most cases, you should only need to use external routes to link to locations that you expect to be outside of your Engine. However, there are instances where you might need a link that could potentially be internal to your Engine. In which case, external routes can still work effectively, since they represent what you want to link to. If the host then tells you that the thing is at a path internal to your Engine, that will still work fine.","route":"docs.links","keywords":[]},"template:docs/quickstart":{"id":"template:docs/quickstart","type":"template","title":"Quickstart","text":"Quickstart Creating An Engine Now that we have all the conceptual and theoretical talk out of the way, let's actually make an Engine! As discussed previously, Engines are distributed as Addons and In-Repo-Addons. Create as In-Repo-Engine To create an engine within an existing application's project, run the in-repo-engine generator: ember g in-repo-engine <engine-name> Note: In-repo addons currently are created in the /lib directory (e.g. /lib/my-addon). Unit tests and integration tests are currently co-mingled with tests for the main application. A separate repo should be used for your engine if you wish to avoid this co-mingling. So, if we name our Engine super-blog, we just do the following: ember g in-repo-engine super-blog This has added a directory named lib and an app addon directory structure named for super-blog. Using the blueprint in-repo-engine, ember-cli has added all the appropriate files to create a new app structure. If you want to share elements between an in-repo engine and application, you could do so with an in-repo addon. For example, the following in-repo engine's package (lib/super-blog/package.json) references the common in-repo addon: { \"name\": \"super-blog\", \"dependencies\": { \"ember-cli-htmlbars\": \"*\", \"ember-cli-babel\": \"*\" }, \"ember-addon\": { \"paths\": [ \"../common\" ] } } Generate in an In-Repo-Engine Using the right flags, generating routes, components (etc) in an in-repo engine is the same as in a regular Ember application. To create a route within an in-repo-engine, you can run: ember generate route <route-name> --in-repo <in-repo-name> To create a component within an in-repo-engine, you can run: ember generate component <component-name> --in-repo <in-repo-name> To generate helpers, controllers and other things, you can use the --in-repo flag like above. Using the --in flag As of ember-cli@3.7 and higher the generate command includes an --in flag that allows you to specify the directory to generate into. For example, given an in-repo addon at lib/my-foo/: ember generate component awesome-sauce --in ./lib/foo Will generate the following files: lib/foo/addon/components/awesome-sauce.js lib/foo/addon/templates/components/awesome-sauce.hbs tests/integration/components/awesome-sauce-test.js Remove from In-Repo-Engine For removing the above generated routes (components and other things) from your engine, replace generate with destroy in the shell command Removing a route from an in-repo engine: ember destroy route <route-name> --in-repo <in-repo-name> Removing a component from an in-repo engine: ember destroy component <component-name> --in-repo <in-repo-name> Create as Addon Separate addon projects can be created with the addon command: ember addon <engine-name> So, if we name our Engine chat-engine, we just do the following: ember addon chat-engine Using a vanilla addon we still need turn it into an engine, follow the steps below. Install Engine Dependencies At this point, you have a vanilla Addon which is not yet an Engine, so let's introduce the remaining pieces needed for it to function as one. First, we need to install the ember-engines addon, which provides support for all the Engines features which haven't been accepted into Ember core yet. Installation is as simple as: cd super-blog/ ember install ember-engines A quick note, Engines should have ember-engines listed as a devDependency and peerDependency. The reason for this is that if you include ember-engines as a dependency of both the host application and the Engine, you'll wind up duplicating some crucial functionality which can cause problems. Therefore, it is best that the host application provide the copy to be used. Finally, we need to ensure ember-cli-htmlbars is listed as a dependency for compiling our templates: // package.json \"dependencies\": { \"ember-cli-htmlbars\": \"^1.1.0\" } Pretty simple so far. At this point, we have everything needed to actually create an Engine, but we don't have an Engine itself. Configuring your Engine Within your Engine's root directory, modify index.js so that your addon is configured as an engine using the EngineAddon extension: // index.js /*jshint node:true*/ const EngineAddon = require('ember-engines/lib/engine-addon'); module.exports = EngineAddon.extend({ name: 'ember-blog', lazyLoading: { enabled: false } }); We'll leave the lazyLoading.enabled flag as false for now, as we'll be discussing the topic of lazy-loading engines in depth later on in this guide. Within your Engine's config directory, modify the environment.js file: // config/environment.js /*jshint node:true*/ 'use strict'; module.exports = function(environment) { const ENV = { modulePrefix: 'ember-blog', environment: environment } return ENV; }; Finally, to make this addon an actual Engine, create a engine.js file under the addon directory: touch addon/engine.js The engine.js file lives inside the addon directory because we want it to be within the Addon's/Engine's namespace. We'll explore this idea more later, but it is important to note for now. Next, add the following code to engine.js: // addon/engine.js import Engine from '@ember/engine'; import loadInitializers from 'ember-load-initializers'; import Resolver from 'ember-resolver'; import config from './config/environment'; const { modulePrefix } = config; export default class YourEngine extends Engine { modulePrefix = modulePrefix; Resolver = Resolver; } loadInitializers(YourEngine, modulePrefix); This code will look familiar to anyone that's seen an Ember Application's app.js file before. Since Engines are so closely related to Applications, it makes sense that their initial files look similar. There are four important points from the engine.js file: config: Each Engine has its own configuration file, similar to the one Ember Applications normally have. It's even found in the same location - config/environment.js Resolver: Engines have their own Resolver. This means they look things up independently of their host application. modulePrefix: Since Engines have their own Resolver, they also must have their own modulePrefix to define which modules belong to their namespace. Since the config is empty by default, you'll want to add this to your config/environment.js file. loadInitializers: Again, since Engines have their own Resolver and thus their own Container, we want to make sure we run initializers against the Engine on boot-up so they can perform tasks like injections. Aside: App Vs Addon Namespace Let's take a moment to talk about namespaces. Every Ember Application has a namespace defined by its modulePrefix value. This namespace allows your Resolver to find the modules created by Ember-CLI at runtime. You'll likely have noticed before that if you try to import a module that is in your app directory, then you need to use the modulePrefix instead. So, if you have the file app/components/foo-bar.js and the modulePrefix baz, you'll have to look it up using baz/components/foo-bar. Similarly, Addons, and therefore Engines, have their own namespace defined by their name value in their index.js. Anything in the addon directory, gets put into the Addon's namespace. Having a separate namespace is one of the primary ways Engines achieve code isolation. As long as the modulePrefix for your application doesn't match the name of an Addon, then your application won't be able to resolve modules living in your Addon. This is why it is important that Engines have their own Resolver with a separate modulePrefix that matches the Addon's name. Observant developers might also note that Addon's have an app directory in addition to their addon directory. The app directory from an Addon gets merged into the host's namespace. This allows Addons to \"re-export\" modules from their own namespace into the namespace of the consumer so that they can be used as if part of the host. Engines, however, should never re-export modules into their host, and so anything placed into the app directory of an Engine Addon will not be included in the build. Adding Routes for Routable Engines At this point, if you're building a Route-less Engine, then you're done and can skip ahead to the \"Mounting An Engine\" section. If, however, you're building a Routable Engine, then you need to create one more file: touch addon/routes.js The routes.js file defines the route map for a routable Engine. The contents are fairly simple: import buildRoutes from 'ember-engines/routes'; export default buildRoutes(function() { // route map }); The callback passed to buildRoutes functions the same way as Router#map does in a normal application. This means, the routes.js file for our super-blog might look something like: import buildRoutes from 'ember-engines/routes'; export default buildRoutes(function() { this.route('new'); this.route('post', { path: 'post/:id' }, function() { this.route('comments', function() { this.route('comment', { path: ':id' }); }); }); }); Mounting An Engine Now that we have our Engine created, we need to \"mount\" it in our application so that we can use it. First, however, we should probably talk about templates and top-level routes. Engine Templates & Top-Level Routes In order to actually verify that our Engine renders properly, we need to add a template. mkdir addon/templates touch addon/templates/application.hbs Note that the template we added is called application. This is because the top-level route and template in an Engine are known as application, similar to what happens with the top-level in a normal application. This means that from within an Engine, if you want to transition to the first route, you would use application as the name instead of the location that the host application knows about. Anyway, let's add something super simple to our template: <h3>Hello World!</h3> Now we'll be able to verify that our Engine renders when we mount it. Loading phases Engines can exist in several phases: Booted - an engine that's been installed in a parent application will have its dependencies loaded and its (non-instance) initializers invoked when the parent application boots. Mounted - Routable and route-less engines have slightly different concepts of \"mounting\". A routable engine is considered mounted when it has been included by a router at one or more mount-points. A route-less engine is considered mounted as soon as a route's mount call resolves. Instantiated - When an engine is instantiated, an EngineInstance is created and an engine's instance initializers are invoked. A routable engine is instantiated when a route is visited at or beyond its mount-point. A route-less engine is instantiated as soon as it is mounted. Special before and after hooks could be added to application instance initializers that allow them to be ordered relative to engine instance initializers. Routable Engines The technique to mount an Engine into your application varies by the type of Engine you're using. We'll cover routable Engines first. Mounting a Routable Engine is done through the consumer's Router map, like so: Router.map(function() { this.mount('super-blog'); }); Pretty straightforward. The mount method is very similar to the route method you would normally use to define routes. You can specify a path and resetNamespace options like you normally would: Router.map(function() { this.mount('super-blog', { resetNamespace: true, path: '/blog' }); }); You can also specify a special property, as, which allows you to mount more than one instance of an Engine by specifying the route name it'll live under: Router.map(function() { this.mount('super-blog', { path: '/blog' }); this.mount('super-blog', { as: 'dev-blog', path: '/dev-blog' }); }); This means that if you transitioned to super-blog, you'll land on /blog, but if you transition to dev-blog, you'll land on /dev-blog. Other than as, the key difference between mount and route is how you specify child routes. For route you would normally pass a callback function as an additional argument. With Engines, though, we want our routing structure to be isolated from the host application, and so child routes are defined in the Engines routes.js file discussed in the previous section. Thus, when using this.mount, the buildRoutes function exported from routes.js gets used as the callback you would normally pass to this.route. That about covers it for routable Engines, let's talk about route-less Engines now. Route-less Engines Route-less Engines are much more straightforward to mount in an application. To mount a route-less Engine, you use the {{mount}} keyword in any of your templates: {{mount \"super-blog\"}} And that's it! The Engine's application.hbs will be rendered into the DOM at the mount location. Prior to Ember 2.16, the {{mount}} helper only accepts an Engine's name, no other variables are supported. As of Ember 2.16 a model argument can be used to pass state and/or context directly to an engine. An inline hash can even be used to pass components via model. For more information, please see the documentation for this helper.","route":"docs.quickstart","keywords":[]},"template:docs/routable-vs-routeless":{"id":"template:docs/routable-vs-routeless","type":"template","title":"Routable Vs. Route-less","text":"Routable Vs. Route-less Finally, there are two types of Engines that you could potentially encounter: routable and route-less. Routable Engines are, as the name implies, Engines which are able to be routed to. This means that they live at a designated route in your application and can have their own internal routes which you can navigate to. Examples of good candidates for routable Engines are admin control panels or blogging systems. Route-less Engines, on the other hand, are Engines which are not able to be routed to. This means that they don't live at a specific route, but are instead mounted within a template or your application. Examples of good candidates for route-less Engines are chat boxes or complex forms.","route":"docs.routable-vs-routeless","keywords":[]},"template:docs/services":{"id":"template:docs/services","type":"template","title":"Services","text":"Services In addition to external routes, you can also specify Services as dependencies of your Engine which are provided from the host application. For example: // super-blog/addon/engine.js export default class SuperBlog extends Engine { // ... dependencies = { services: [ 'store', 'session' ] } }); This means that your Engine will expect the host application to provide both the store service and session service that it uses. The host application can then specify the services it provides like so: // dummy/app/app.js export default class App extends Application { // ... constructor() { super(...arguments); this.engines = { superBlog: { dependencies: { services: [ 'store', { 'session': 'user-session' } ] } } } } } In this example, the host provides its store service for the Engine's store. The Engine's session service, however, is actually the user-session service of the host. Thus, you can provide a re-mapping of service names by using an object instead of a simple string. However, if you have ServiceX in Engine B, and want to share that service with Engine A, you'd need to create a separate addon (likely an in-repo addon in the host app) to share those services accross. Currently, Services are the sanctioned way of passing state and data between the host and the Engine. Since Services are singletons and only passed from host-to-child, there is little risk of coupling and violation of isolation. That said, you should keep the number of services your Engine relies on to a minimum so that your host does not need to provide services fulfilling all of those interfaces.","route":"docs.services","keywords":[]},"template:docs/sharing-code":{"id":"template:docs/sharing-code","type":"template","title":"Sharing code","text":"Sharing code For Engines, globally relevant constructs, such as Services and Route paths, make sense to cross Engine boundaries because they should be unique throughout the system. Non-global constructs, such as Components, Helpers, and Utilities should be handled carefully to avoid incidental coupling with a specific host design/architecture. For instance, having to provide several route paths and services, such as Ember Data's Store, creates a relatively easy to fulfill API for consumers of your Engine. If your Engine also required specific components, helpers, and utilities, all needing to conform to the API usage inside your Engine, then you all of a sudden have substantially more coupling involved. This is bad for isolation and does not give you flexibility in developing your Engine independently of your host. However, there are use cases for needing to share components and more across Engine boundaries. In those instances, the proper solution is to move the shared constructs into an addon. Addon Re-exports In order to use things like Components and Helpers from addons in your Engine, they will need to be present in your Engine's namespace. This is accomplished by doing what is called a \"re-export\": //super-blog/app/components/foo-bar.js export { default } from 'super-addon/components/foo-bar'; As you can see we're simply exporting the import from super-addon. Since we're exporting an export, we call it re-exporting. As you can imagine, doing this for everything in the addons you need to use could be very tedious. So ember-engines provides a simple way to automatically re-export everything an addon usually provides to an application: the EngineAddon base class. The EngineAddon base class hooks into Ember-CLI's build hooks to automatically re-export addon code into your Engine. You can add it to your Engine like so: // super-blog/index.js const EngineAddon = require('ember-engines/lib/engine-addon'); module.exports = EngineAddon.extend({ name: 'super-blog' }); That's it! Now, any addon included in your package.json dependencies key will automatically get included in your Engine.","route":"docs.sharing-code","keywords":[]},"template:docs/testing-acceptance":{"id":"template:docs/testing-acceptance","type":"template","title":"Acceptance Testing","text":"Acceptance Testing Testing Standalone Engine The first step is mounting the engine on the dummy app: // admin-engine/tests/dummy/app/router.js import EmberRouter from '@ember/routing/router'; import config from './config/environment'; export default class Router extends EmberRouter { location = config.locationType; rootURL = config.rootURL; } Router.map(function() { this.mount('admin-engine', { path: '/' }); }); export default Router; Now you can write tests in the same way as in a normal Ember application. Suppose that we are setting users route on engine router: import buildRoutes from 'ember-engines/routes'; export default buildRoutes(function() { this.route('users'); }); Here is an acceptance test for routing: // admin-engine/tests/acceptance/basic-test.js import { module, test } from 'qunit'; import { setupApplicationTest } from 'ember-qunit'; import { visit, click, currentURL } from '@ember/test-helpers'; module('basic acceptance test', function(hooks) { setupApplicationTest(hooks); test('the user can visit home page', async function(assert) { await visit('/'); await click('.user-menu-item'); assert.equal(currentURL(), '/users'); }); }); Stubbing services In cases where engines have services dependencies, it is possible to stub these dependencies for acceptance tests. The first step is to specify on the dummy app the services provided by host-app like so: // admin-engine/tests/dummy/app/app.js import Application from '@ember/application'; export default class App extends Application { // ... constructor() { super(...arguments); this.engines = { adminEngine: { dependencies: { services: ['location-service'] } } } } } To stub the location service in your test, create a local stub object that extends Service from @ember/service, and register the stub as the service your test. // admin-engine/tests/acceptance/basic-test.js import { module, test } from 'qunit'; import { setupApplicationTest } from 'ember-qunit'; import { visit, click, currentURL } from '@ember/test-helpers'; import Service from '@ember/service'; //Stub location service class LocationStub extends Service { city = 'New York'; country = 'USA'; currentLocation = { x: 1234, y: 5678 }; getCurrentCity() { return this.city; } getCurrentCountry() { return this.country; } } module('basic acceptance test', function(hooks) { setupApplicationTest(hooks); test('the user can visit home page', async function(assert) { this.owner.register('service:location-service', LocationStub); await visit('/'); await click('.user-menu-item'); assert.equal(currentURL(), '/users'); }); }); Stubbing external routes In cases where engines have externalRoutes dependencies, it is possible to stub these dependencies for acceptance tests. The first step is to specify on the dummy app the external routes provided by host-app like so: // admin-engine/tests/dummy/app/app.js import Application from '@ember/application'; export default class App extends Application { // ... constructor() { super(...arguments); this.engines = { adminEngine: { dependencies: { externalRoutes: ['home'] } } } } } To stub the external route service in your test, create a local stub object that extends Service from @ember/service, and register the stub as the service your test. // admin-engine/tests/acceptance/basic-test.js import { module, test } from 'qunit'; import { setupApplicationTest } from 'ember-qunit'; import { visit, click, currentURL } from '@ember/test-helpers'; import Service from '@ember/service'; module('basic acceptance test', function(hooks) { setupApplicationTest(hooks); test('the user can click on the home button and trigger external transition', async function(assert) { this.owner.unregister('service:router'); this.owner.register( 'service:router', class extends Service { transitionToExternal(actual) { let expected = 'home'; assert.equal(actual, expected); } } ); await visit('/'); await click('.back-to-home'); }); }); Testing Host Application Sometimes it is necessary to write acceptance tests on the host app because some engines have flows that depend on the host app such as services that interact a lot with a host app or a redirect to an external context by external routes. Therefore, in acceptance tests normally we try to avoid mocking external dependencies, since this kind of test is supposed to test things as close to \"real life\" as possible. Eager Engines The tests are written in the same way as in a normal Ember application. Lazy Engines If you have a lazy engine, you'll need to ensure that your tests/test-helper.js is configured to preload your engine's assets: // <app-name>/tests/test-helper.js import Application from '../app'; import config from '../config/environment'; import { setApplication } from '@ember/test-helpers'; import { start } from 'ember-qunit'; import preloadAssets from 'ember-asset-loader/test-support/preload-assets'; import manifest from '<app-name>/config/asset-manifest'; setApplication(Application.create(config.APP)); preloadAssets(manifest).then(start); // This ensures all engine resources are loaded before the tests Suppose that we are mouting admin-engine on host-app router: // <app-name>/app/router.js import EmberRouter from '@ember/routing/router'; import config from './config/environment'; export default class Router extends EmberRouter { location = config.locationType; rootURL = config.rootURL; } Router.map(function() { this.mount('admin-engine', { path: 'admin' }); }); export default Router; Here is an acceptance test for routing: // <app-name>/tests/acceptance/basic-test.js import { module, test } from 'qunit'; import { setupApplicationTest } from 'ember-qunit'; import { visit, click, currentURL } from '@ember/test-helpers'; module('basic acceptance test', function(hooks) { setupApplicationTest(hooks); test('the user can visit /admin page', async function(assert) { await visit('/'); await click('.admin-menu-item'); assert.equal(currentURL(), '/admin'); }); });","route":"docs.testing-acceptance","keywords":[]},"template:docs/testing-integration":{"id":"template:docs/testing-integration","type":"template","title":"Integration Testing","text":"Integration Testing Suppose that our engine has a component: {{!-- admin-engine/addon/components/hello-name.hbs --}} Hello, {{@name}}!
